# Community Detection Algorithms and Computational Law

Law can only operate when applied to facts in human context. Human contexts are inherently social, involving people involved in some type of group. Groups have discernable sizes, shapes, behaviors and lifespans.  Recently, the corner of data science known as "community detection" has provided powerful tools that reveal the fundamental nature and dynamics of social groups.  The truths revealed about communities by the emerging field of computational social science are intimately relevant to law.  Law is the profession and field of social science that can conclusively define and govern the roles and relationships of, by and between people in every kind of community.  Legal rules establish all rights and responsibilities enforceable by or against every individual in any group.  Whether any given legal rule applies can depend completely on intricately detailed aspects of the community giving rise to the legal question.  The capabilities afforded by computational social science to model, describe and predict the state at any moment and dynamics over time of communities provides novel opportunities for accurately, fairly and objectively applying law to facts and ensuring predictable legal outcomes.  Eventually, capabilities of community detection algorithms may evolve to become an important new foundation of law in the digital age. 

## Prime Example: Project Immersion

The MIT Media Lab project knowns as Immersion uses community detection visualization of your social graph using nothing more than the metadata of your email interactions. You can see a working demo at: https://immersion.media.mit.edu/demo and check out your own communities using emails accounts on Gmail, Yahoo or an organizational MS Exchange at: https://immersion.media.mit.edu  

The above demo and current public release only depict individual networks, however next version (currently known as “Immersion teams”) enables multiple people to overlay their individual social graphs to reveal how communities and organizations are interconnected.  As individuals, organizations and other groups gain the routine ability ascertain and map their communities at any moment and over any period of time, there will be significant opportunities, threats and other implications for business, government, entertainment and practically all areas of the economy of fields of activity. Perhaps no field will be more greatly implacted by or make greater use of this emerging technology than the law.
